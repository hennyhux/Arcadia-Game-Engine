Comments: 

	This class takes advantage of the state design pattern by having different states. The WarpVine.cs class is derived from the AbstractBlock
	interface and the states of the WarpVine are all derived from the AbstractBlockStates. This class works similarly to the warp pipe.
	Since everything is inherited from each other there is more reusuable code. 

	
Hypothetical Change:  

	One hypothetical change would be to seperate the states into seperate files for easier readability. I also noticed in methods
	that we are inherriting from the interfaces that we are not implementing do not throw an exception.

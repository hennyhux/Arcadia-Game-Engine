Comments:	
			I decided to do my code review on the Lakitu.cs class Lakitu is a new enemy that we decided to add in 
			this sprint so it implements AbstractEnemy. The class in general looks too long and I believe this leads
			to smelly code. I think splitting this into more classes would make it more easy to the eyes as well 
			as simpler to understand.
		
Time Taken to Complete Code Review: 20 minutes
Hypothetical Change: 
			As previously mentioned, the class is very long and it contains a lot of if statements that could 
			be simplified into a single one. Perhaps using more methods could be helpful as well since what is
			making the class long are the long methods in it. Simpler tasks make for better visualization, for
			example the Update method could be split up to give a better idea of what is going on.

Sprint Number: 5
Name of File: UberGoomba
Author of File/Method: Henry Zhang
Comments: The UberGoomba file doesn't follow the state design pattern perfectly. The
	object itself doesn't have a sprite whilst the state holds the sprite for the object.
	Also, the states themselves hold a instance of the ubergoomba instead of using the base
	method to get a instance of mario.
	
	
	
Hypothetical Change:
	Move the state sprite into the object's sprite and change all the methods updating
	the StateSprite to be updating the sprite instead. Add use the base method in constructor
	to get an instance of the object. Also move variables from within the state
	to be within the object itself.

	
	Change 
	protected StateUberGoomba(UberGoomba enemy)
        {
            this.enemy = enemy;
        }

	Into
	public StateUberGoomba(UberGoomba enemy)
            : base(enemy)
        {

        }

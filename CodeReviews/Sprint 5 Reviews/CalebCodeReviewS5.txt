Comments: This class derived form the AbstractEnemy class as it should because, well it is an enemy.
The class implements all of the necassary methods to correctly inherit from AbstractEnemy.
The methods however seem to be very smelly. Lots of if statements and other code smells. This is due to 
the state checking throughout the methods. 

	
Hypothetical Change: One hypothetical change would be to actually have the different states implement the 
all of the logic in the update method. This would get rid of quite a few of the state checks and get rid 
of a few code smells.

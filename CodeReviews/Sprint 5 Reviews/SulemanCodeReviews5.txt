Comments: These classes use command pattern to spawn enemies near mario's proximity. Each spawn command class 
respectfully implements the methods from ICommand and the corresponding item/enemy is then spawned into the game.
It follows the command patterns we used for other aspects of the game and can easily be used to accomodate
new items/enemies into the game

	
Hypothetical Change: Since these are supposed to be cheat codes, it would have been better to use a literal in place 
of a keystroke to active the cheats. For example, a sequence of characters would activate a certain cheat code. Additionaly, 
it would be better if some items (such as enemies) spawn in different places of the map making it more challenging.

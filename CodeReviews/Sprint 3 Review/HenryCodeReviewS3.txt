Comments:
	This method should take full advantages of method overrloading and be broken up into seperate methods with same names but different arguments. This ensures that when 
	objects invoke the method and pass in its own type, then the method signature ensures that the correct method inside entity manager is called. Since the method takes an IGameObject
	var as a parameter, this means that ANY IGameObject can be passed into the method, even those not "allowed" by the programming logic inside the method. 

	
Hypothetical Change:
	Break IsGoingToFall(IGameObjects fallingObject) into:

	IsGoingToFall(FireFlower ff);
	IsGoingToFall(SuperShroom ss);
	IsGoingToFall(OneUpShroom ous);

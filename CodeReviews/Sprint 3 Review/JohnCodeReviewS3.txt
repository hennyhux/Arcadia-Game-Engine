Comments: The state design pattern isn't implemented properly for the koopas, the logic for switching between koopa states is here
	instead of in the koopaState files themselves. The class doesn't have its own abstract green koopa to extend it just extends IGameObjects.
	
Hypothetical Change:
	Move all transitioning between states for the koopas into their respective state files. Make a green koopa abstract class
	and make this current file extend and implement it.

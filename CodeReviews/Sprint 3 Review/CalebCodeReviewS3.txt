Comments: 

	It doesnt make sense for every class to have the same methods in them dealing with collision. 
	Having all of this repeatable code is a very bad code smell and makes our classes hard to follow.
	

	
Hypothetical Change:
	
	Create a collision based class that deals with all of the repeating code in every object class.

Sprint Number: 3
Name of File: Loader.cs
Author of File/Method: Beto Cruz
Comments: I did my code Review on Beto's Loader.cs class. I looked at it last time and this time it seems like he addressed most of the feedback given by the professor from Sprint 2. 
He created a new method where everything gets loaded instead of having it split in different methods having to deserialize the xml file multiple times.
	
Hypothetical Change:
I believe he could still clear up his code a little more to make it more understandable and perhaps delete what he did before and is not used anymore. 
I know that the other methods were still being used by my other teammates but for next sprint, i believe they should all use the newer version.

Comments:
		I decided to do my Code Review on Suleman's ResetCommand.cs. Suleman created a method in the gameroot Reset() which 
		essentially calls Initialize. He included the loadContent method within initialize which essentially re-loads 
		everything added in the load content to its initial state. The current implementation is easily reusable and expandable
		if he decided to add more things that needed to be reset.
Time Taken to Complete Code Review: 30 minutes
Hypothetical Change:
		In the future sprints we will need to account for player scores/time and so we can use the reset() method created to 
		account for any incoming paramters that might need to be reset. This can easily be done with the curent implmentation
		of reset() by loading the intital states of each parameter.

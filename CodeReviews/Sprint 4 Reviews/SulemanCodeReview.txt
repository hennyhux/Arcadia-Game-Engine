Comments: 
Henry's state design implementation has made it much easier to implement different states that honor different types of input, the pause and game over
PBI's as an example honor only specific inputs and so making use of the gamestates design makes it easier to adapt to different "states" that we might want to add in 
sprint 5 which might honor specific inputs.

Hypothetical Change:
 The reset and restart methods are kind of conflicting, from my observation of playing the game, the reset method would keep the scores and coin count
 it can be adjusted so that the reset only resets the items that need to be reset while restart would load everything to its initial state.

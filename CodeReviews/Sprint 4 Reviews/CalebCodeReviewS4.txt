Comments: 

	This class made so many other classes very simple. This class deals only with collision. In the past, every entity that had any sort of collsion had methods in its own class.
	This singleton class CollisionHandler simplified every single entity class that dealt with collision. It made all of the much easier to understand and follow one specific job. 
	Along with that we actually had reusable code! Instead of having the same methods in every class we were able to use the CollisionHandler and all of its methods.
	
Hypothetical Change:

	One hypothetical change I have is in the Mario Region of the CollisionHandler class. There is one method MarioToItemCollision that is repeated many times.
	The only difference in the methods is the type of item passed in as a parameter. I think we should have had a better naming convention then keeping the same name.
	Another thing is this method could be one method and instead of having different parameters it would take one in and have a switch case to determine what item it was. 
	This would lead to code smells because of the switch case but I think readability and length of the class would benefit instead of having multiple methods.

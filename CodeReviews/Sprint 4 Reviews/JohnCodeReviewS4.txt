Comments: Every single thing that is needed to play a level is loaded in in the LoadContent method, each method is very effective, 
	Additonally, the commands/inputs that are allowed can be set in this file and any other inputs will not be registered.

Hypothetical Change:
	The Reset() and Restart() methods are almost identical and could possibly combined into 1 method. Additonally,
	If you are restarting the level it could be possible to not need to reload in everything again for the level to run properly and
	only reloaded in the objects that have been modified since the start of the level.

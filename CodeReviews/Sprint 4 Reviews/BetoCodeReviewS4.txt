Name of File: State class

Comments:	I decided to do my code review on the State class inside PlayingGameState.cs since it made pretty big changes to the whole game
			and coding experience. I think it makes it really easy to follow and change between different Game States. It makes the transitions
			from Playing to GameOver or to Victory much better to follow. This abstract class is used by other classes separated instead of 
			having GameRoot contain a bunch of different methods that would have to deal with all the state changes. 
		
Time Taken to Complete Code Review: 30 minutes
Hypothetical Change: However, I do think that, because we are basically done with the game, our methods inside the PlayingGameState.cs class
			are getting too long (i.e. LoadContent()), so we can add more methods that do some of the tasks of these long methods. This will
			lead to cleaner and much easier to understand code. Also, to make the file smaller as well, we could implement State in a different 
			file (not inside of PlayingGameState.cs).

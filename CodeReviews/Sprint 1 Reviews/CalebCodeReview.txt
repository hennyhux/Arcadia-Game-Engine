Sprint Number: Sprint 1
Name of File: MarioState.cs

Comments: 

	I decided to write about MarioState.cs because it is a very critical part of the sprint along with the rest of the mario game as a whole.
	This class inherits ISprite and uses a MarioFactory and a MarioSprite. MarioState.cs takes responsibilty for taking care of the state that
	mario is in. It has methods for every state and takes advantage of the MarioSprite classes to make the actual change to the sprite.
	The actual code that has not been commented out and makes a lot of sense. I think some cleaning up is in order because there are multiple
	Update methods (one commented) and also multpile Draw methods (one commented). It looks like some of the code from the MarioSprite.cs 
	class is still in there. 

Time Taken to Complete: 35 Minutes
Hypothetical Change: 

	A hypothetical change to the game would be to allow the user to pick different main characters at the start of the game. The current 
	implementation would easily support this change becasue you would just have to make another main character state (LuigiState.cs) and
	follow all the logic provided in MarioState.cs

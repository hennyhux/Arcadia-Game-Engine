Comments:
	I decided to do my Code Review on Henry's implementation of EntityManager.cs because that was
	one of the classes I used to be able to do the loading of the level. In my opinion, I think 
	Henry came up with a really clever way of keeping tabs on all objects created (as long as 
	they are added to the EntityManager). Another thing he did in this class was create methods 
	that helped handle collision detection as well as moving and finding an object's ID.
 
Time Taken to Complete Code Review: 25 minutes
Hypothetical Change:
	One hypothetical change I think would be benefitial is to make each object in the EntityManager
	have some kind of boolean variable that knows whether or not an item should be visible (and 
	when it should be). This would help particularly in the next sprint for when the loader class
	loads bricks that have items displayed above them whenever Mario jumps and touches them.

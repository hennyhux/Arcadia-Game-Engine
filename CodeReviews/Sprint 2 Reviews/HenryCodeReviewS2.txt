	Upon first glace, there are seperate methods for loading all different game objects into a list that is used
	by entitymanager to create a working game. XML was the format that the team decided to use to load a certain level. Upon first glance, there doesnt 
	appear to be anything too complex in the code, and a relative path was used for the XML path so it will work on everyone's machines 
	
Hypothetical Change:
	Due to the nature of the clas (it really only has one task), there isnt much that I would change. The code does not exactly "smell" in the sense that 
	there is a really high complexity (too many if loops, etc), the ENUMS all use very clear names that indicate what exactly is being detected in
	the XML file.

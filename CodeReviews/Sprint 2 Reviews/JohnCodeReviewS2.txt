Sprint Number: 2
Name of File: QuestionBlock.cs
Author of File: Henry Zhang
Comments:
	This file does not follow the state design pattern completely, this is no Block context file and there is no way to 
	transform this Block into a different Block. The file does not update itself, it updates its sprite which is not following the state design pattern.
	This file does not have a QuestionBlockState file but acts somewhat like both the block context and questionBlock State file.
	It has a state and a sprite but the state is not questionBlockState its the state of the BumpBlock.
	
Hypothetical Change:
	Make this file either the context for all the blocks or make this a block state for the question block. Add methods that would allow this block to changes states such that
	it would become a different type of block. By changing this to a questionBlockState file, remove all unnecessary variables that would be stored in the Block.cs file
 	and remove the state and sprite variables for this file and move them into Block.cs. Add the necessary commands like Enter() and Exit() for this state.

Comments: 

	MarioSprite.cs was ingeniously implemented. By representing the spreadsheet as several arrays, it makes traversing the original 
	sprite sheet easy, as well as make Mario state animations more concise, as there does not need to
	exist separate concrete class for each different possible Mario states (it is all within in class). Furthermore, the comments inside the 
	class provided much needed clarity.
	
Time Taken to Complete: 35 Minutes
Hypothetical Change: 

	I would make some of the integer numbers that represent Mario states as Enums just for readability’s sake. Some private methods would 
	also be helpful to reduce the cyclomatic complexity of the code.

Comments: 

 I decided to review the enemy folder which contains the sprites that represents the enemy characters, these sprites implent the interface ISprite. These specific sprites 
 project the animation for each enemy in the enemy sprite factory which are interconnected the game objects. Caleb structured the code very well for any future adjustments 
 that can be made. The enemy sprites play a significant role as they are interconnected with all the enemy objects classes and it is important that each enemy sprite correctly depicts 
 the corresponding enemy appropriately.

Time Taken to Complete: 20 Minutes
Hypothetical Change: 

	A  change to the game would be to add different types of enemies at start of the game depending on the level difficulty. Caleb's 
	implemantation of the sprites would easily support this change as he would just have to make a new sprite class depcting the new enemy with some minor 
	adjustments such as the animations and postion on the screen.
